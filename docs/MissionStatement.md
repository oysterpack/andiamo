## Problem Statement
Many enterprises rely on software speed and agility to achieve strategic business advantage.The cloud is a game changer 
because it enables light speed business advantage. The cloud provides strategic drivers for businesses. It's always been 
about speed and agility.

The problem is that speed comes at a high cost. Being able to move at the speed of light is great as long as it does not kill you. 
Speeding recklessly puts yourself and others in danger. Speed requires precision, control, efficiency, quality, care, and maintenance.  
Speed requires skill, focus, responsibility, and attention to detail.

There are many problems and challenges enterprises must overcome in order to survive and adapt. Otherwise, they will face the 
same fate as the great giant dinosaurs of the past: 

1. Legacy software is too **dangerous** to run in the cloud.
2. Legacy software has too much **technical debt** to run in the cloud.
3. Legacy software is too **costly** and **inefficient** to run in the cloud.
4. Enterprises are spending too much capital and time on managing cloud infrastructure instead of leveraging
   the cloud to solve real business problems and deliver real business value.
5. The cloud is all new territory. It's very young. It's rapidly changing, evolving, and improving.
   How can enterprises keep pace and leverage the cloud to achieve strategic business advantage?
